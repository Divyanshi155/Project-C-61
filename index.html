        <p> Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop that is 10 feet high, mounted to a backboard at each end.The baselines or end lines are the lines located on the ends of the court. The baselines are used to denote inbounds and out of bounds on the court. Depending on who you talk to, you may hear someone call these lines either the baselines or end lines.On each half-court, painted lines show the free throw lane and circle, as well as the three-point arc, whose distance from the basket varies based on the level of hoops being played.When we shoot or dribble a basketball, we shoot/dribble it no matter how the stripes comes into contact with our hands. The stripes are the seams where the panels meet. I like to hold the ball a specific way when shooting free throws or in a Tripoli threat position because it makes my shot feel more consistent.A player who commits five personal fouls over the course of a 40-minute game, or six in a 48-minute game, fouls out and is disqualified for the remainder of the game.</p>
